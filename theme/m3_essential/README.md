# About this Theme

This is a complementary theme for [Essential Moodle Theme](https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=theme_essential), built and tested in Mahara 1.8

Cool features of the theme

* Uses "responsive" design to adapt to the available screen space

* Uses "FontAwesome" for rendering icons in blocks

* Clean and sipe design should appeal to those wanting a "professional" look

# Using this theme

* Clone this repo as the "essential" directory in /theme:

      git clone git://github.com/moodleman/mahara-theme_essential.git essential

* Visit Site Administration > Site options > Site settings and choose it

* Use and enjoy

# IMPORTANT

The theme is still a work in progress with some formatting still to be added as testing continues. Please log your bugs here in Github.
