<h3>Login</h3>
<p>Your login details will either be the username and password you entered during registration or that were assigned to you by an administrator.</p>
<p>In some cases, you may not be able to use this login box, but will have a different way of logging in, e.g. via Moodle or single sign-on. Your administrator will have told you where to log in if that is the case.</p>
<p>Click the "<a href="forgotpass.php">Lost username / password</a>" link to request a password reset at any time. If your authentication method is managed elsewhere, you will receive an error message and will need to contact your administrator to find out where you can reset your account details.</p>
<p>If you logged in to the site a while ago, you will be logged out automatically after a period of inactivity. That is for your security. You will be prompted to log in again.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This site requires a recent version of Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer or Safari.</p>
