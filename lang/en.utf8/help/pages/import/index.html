<h3>Import a portfolio</h3>
<p>You can import your (or any valid Leap2A) portfolio from another Mahara site yourself.</p>
<p>During the import process, you will be asked what you want to do with content that is in your import file. You can decide whether you want to add it to your account or whether you want to ignore it.</p>
<p>You can only import a Leap2A file, but not an HTML file. If you want to import content from another Mahara site, go there and export your portfolio as Leap2A file. You do not have to export your entire portfolio, but you can choose which pages or collections and thus the artefacts contained on them you wish to export.</p>
