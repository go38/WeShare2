<h3>Import skin(s)</h3>
<p>
You can import skins from other Mahara sites.
That way, you don't have to start from scratch creating a skin,
but can build on top of an existing one.
</p>
<p>
You can find skins that other people have created on the
<a href="https://wiki.mahara.org/index.php/Page_skins" target="_blank">Mahara wiki</a>.
