<h3>Skins</h3>
<p>
Skins help you customise the look of your portfolio pages to give them a personal touch.
</p>
<p>
You can add backgrounds, change text colours, fonts, buttons, and even add your own custom CSS.
</p>
<p>
If other people created skins and made them available for you to use,
you will see them here on this page. You can favourite skins from others so that
you can use them on your own pages.</p> <p>You can also import skins from
other Mahara instances or export your skins to share with others.
