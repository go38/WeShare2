<h3>Collections</h3>
<p>A collection is a set of pages that are linked to one another and have the same access permissions. You can create as many collections as you like, but a page cannot appear in more than one collection.</p>
<p>You can create a collection from scratch or copy an existing one - either one of your own or one from another user that is copyable to you.</p>
